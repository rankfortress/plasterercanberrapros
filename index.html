	Plastering is one of the most common jobs that plasterers do. Plastering can be completed for new homes, extensions to existing homes and commercial property renovations. It’s not a difficult job but it does require some skill in order to produce an excellent finish. A plaster needs two coats; firstly you need to make a plaster-board, then it’s time to mix the first coat.Plastering work is completed in two coats using either a trowel or putty knife and finished with sandpaper for a smooth finish. Plasterers can also install drywall, cornice & suspended ceilings as well as installing gyprock onto new homes or extensions to existing homes.
